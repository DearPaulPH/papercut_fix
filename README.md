The OpenStreetMap project is impossible without volunteers who contribute their time, skills, and resources.

The primary goal of the repository is to document local map issues. As a project largely governed by [do-ocracy](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=do-ocracy), the public are strongly encouraged to always try to resolve the issue themselves first and fore-most.

By posting a request here, you acknowledge that this repository is maintained by volunteers who also seek to create a better local map on OSM, but are not obligated to resolve any requests made herein, or follow any specific action or timeline.
